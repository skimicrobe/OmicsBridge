# OmicsBridge

We present a novel multi-level clustering approachto characeterize microbiome signatures using multi-omics data. Two clustering strategies are implemented to explore the influence of order of omics data in the integration process.
By incorporating all three omics layers, the final clusters are based on the collective results from each-omics data type and are less prone to the biases inherent in single-omics analyses.
